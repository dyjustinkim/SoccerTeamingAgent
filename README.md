# SoccerTeamingAgent
Program to Predict Soccer Formations with Machine Learning

# Main Function
To run the entire code process from initial data collection to output prediction, run the main file. This file calls all the files corresponding to steps in the prediction process.
You should see a folder tot24-25 show up, which will become populated with the iterations of data and transformations. Finally, it will output predictions.

The Main function may crash due to high volality in the web driver functions; in this case, it is best to delete the output folder (tot24-25) before re-running the function. 

# Evaluation
Run the evaluation.py score to evaluate the predictions against historical results.
